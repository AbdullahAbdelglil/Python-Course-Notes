#
# Naming convention and rules:
# u can start ur variable with [a-z or A-Z] or underscore (_)
# u can write in both camel case: userName, or snake case: user_name
# u can't use the variable before assign value to it.
# case-sensitive
#
# python has a reserved keywords, u can list them using: help("keywords")
#
# python is dynamically-typed language.
# it means that you donâ€™t need to declare the type of variable when you create it,
# The type of variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.
# mn ela5er: no need to declare data types
